Angular Folder Structure
========================

Based on best practices from the community, other github Angular projects,
developer experience from production Angular projects, and contributors,
this project goal is to create a skeleton structure which is
flexible for projects big or small.

This project defines directory structure in an Angular application
and it is a working application.  The code for this project can be found at
`https://github.com/mathisGarberg/angular-folder-structure <https://github.com/mathisGarberg/angular-folder-structure>`_

Directory Tree Sections
------------------------

These are the sections this repository proposes be added to a default
Angular application structure.  Each section is optional

* media
* core
* data
* layout
* modules
* shared
* styles

Please read through the Directory
Structure Parts carefully to understand them all.

Directory Tree Structure
------------------------

This repository suggests two different tree structures.  You are free to design
your own tree structure if these are not suitable.  See the Directory
Structures section for details.
